Title:

Dr StrangeCosmos or: How I learned to stop worrying and Love Data Analytics

Abstract:

Through the prism of two projects I’m currently finishing, I’ll describe how the techniques used commonly in
data analytics are becoming ever more important in theoretical cosmology. One of these projects is concerned with reducing
the computational requirements for accurately *predicting* the key statistical observable measured using probes of the large
scale structure of the Universe. The other project deals with *measuring* higher order statistics (skewness, …) with such
probes. In either case using the standard approach can become very numerically taxing, and in both cases we develop alternatives
which greatly reduce this computational load. The process followed for each project will be familiar to anyone working in data analytics,
as will the tools used, so rather than going into depth about the cosmological significance of the work we’ve done, I’ll instead emphasise
the aforementioned data analytics process.
