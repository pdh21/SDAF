Title:
The times they are a changing. Monitoring land dynamics from space


Abstract:
Since the last 40 years satellites have continuously monitored the earth surface. The spectral information recorded by their sensors can be a valuable data source to assess spatial-temporal change. In the first half of this talk I will give a brief overview of two algorithms that I am currently using to detect structural change in spectral time series, discuss some of their caveats and how this can assist in monitoring land dynamics from space. In the second half, I will go further away from my domain-specific analysis and instead will demonstrate how to store large multi-dimensional arrays and efficiently compute parallel statistical operations using python.
